# Well-logging-data-synthesis
Using machine learning techniques to predict compressional travel-time (DTC) in an offset well
    
 Purpose: Predicting acoustic slowness data from triple compbo logs based on ML model that was built on offset well                       logging data. SB16 well is used to build ML model. The model is then deployed to predict slowness data in SB17                 offsett well.
          This section includes data exploring, cleaning, correcting, completing, creating, converting, and deploying ML                 technique.
